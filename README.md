Snappy Cobra - Global Game Jam Game 2017.

A trippy rithm game you supply with your own music: it performs a FFT analysis on the sound provided and uses its result to make the enemies dance. It won the award of Most Creative Game during the GGJ 2017 in Groningen. Made in [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com).
